Fix:
    Correct casing in path to real filename 
    "system/Window.h" -> "system/window.h"

Problem:

/Users/felixberge/Projects/ C++/212-cpp-game-FelixAtForsberg/tests/test_window.cpp:2:10: warning: non-portable path to file '"system/window.h"'; specified path differs in case from file name on disk [-Wnonportable-include-path]
#include "system/Window.h"
---

FIX: 
Same signature

after:
target_link_libraries( ${TEST_EXECUTABLE} PRIVATE GTest::gtest_main )

                
before :
target_link_libraries( ${TEST_EXECUTABLE} GTest::gtest_main )


Problem:

CMake Error at tests/CMakeLists.txt:30 (target_link_libraries):
  The keyword signature for target_link_libraries has already been used with
  the target "SDLGameProject_tests".  All uses of target_link_libraries with
  a target must be either all-keyword or all-plain.

Fix:
initialize `Texture::renderer`
           `Texture::format` 

Problem:

Run/Debug Configurations gets its info on targets from the project file CMake creates 
when ran on an empty build tree (`cmake .``)

CMake creates its

CMake runs _its_ build creation instruction (using a build system generator defined via argument 
    `-G <generator-name>` )when ran on "an empty build tree" (which I assume means that 
there's no pre-existing, populated directory at the path of `CMAKE_BINARY_DIR`)

"Makefile"

Possible cause: correct architecture target not selected?

#### FIX:
```bash
export ARCHFLAGS="x86_64" # in toolchain environment file (env_clion_eap_llvm.sh),

# CMake & XCode Problem:
    I think it could be that CLion switched to the xcode compiler
    and I think It previously used a brew installed one.

    error: "ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64"

    "This error indicates that your code, usually from the C family language, 
    has imported a header but has not yet been linked to it's implementation."

https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/137a572/cmake_and_linking_external_libraries_is_a_kick_in/
"CMake and Linking External libraries is a kick in the nuts if i've ever seen it."

https://izzys.casa/2020/12/how-to-find-packages-with-cmake-the-basics/
"whether we want to or not, many folks have to interact with CMake at least once in their life.
If they are unlucky, they might have to find dependencies using find_package.
If they are extremely unlucky, they might have to write a file to work with find_package."

"Worse, sometimes these libraries provide <Library>Config.cmake/<library>-config.cmake files which might not create imported targets and simply export cache variables.
One such library is SDL2. 
SDL2 is a wonderfully neat library, but itâ€™s CMake experience leaves a lot to be desired."
